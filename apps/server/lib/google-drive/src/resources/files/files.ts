	 * valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see
	 * [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts
	 * with `files.create` must specify the MIME type
	 * `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in
	 * the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation
	 * to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `"name": "cat.jpg"` in the
	 * metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension`
	 * property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title`
	 * property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file
	 * is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with
	 * extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive
	 * attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.
