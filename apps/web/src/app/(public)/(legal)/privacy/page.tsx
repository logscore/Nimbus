// 				On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may be based outside of the UK, or the
// 				European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;). These countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal
// 				information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the
// 				information.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries:</LegalParagraph>
// 			<ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
// 				<li>
// 					we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data
// 					Protection Act 2018;
// 				</li>
// 				<li>
// 					we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred data, including in transit, such as
// 					standard contractual clauses (&quot;SCCs&quot;) or binding corporate rules.
// 				</li>
// 			</ul>

// 			<LegalHeading3>Your Data Subject Rights</LegalHeading3>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of
// 				your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you
// 				believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal
// 				information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection
// 				in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that
// 				is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate
// 				grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the
// 				processing of your personal information.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with how your data is collected,
// 				processed, shared and stored.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you at
// 				any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR
// 				request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for your personal data to be erased
// 				from the records held by organizations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only
// 				apply in certain circumstances.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>When may the right to erasure apply?</LegalParagraph>
// 			<ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
// 				<li>
// 					When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or
// 					processed for.
// 				</li>
// 				<li>
// 					If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that consent has been withdrawn.
// 					{COMPANY_NAME} relies on consent to process personal data in very few circumstances.
// 				</li>
// 				<li>
// 					The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing personal data and an individual
// 					has exercised the right to object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding legitimate
// 					grounds to refuse that request.
// 				</li>
// 				<li>
// 					Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a person&apos;s name and email address,
// 					and the individual objects to that processing.
// 				</li>
// 				<li>There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be destroyed.</li>
// 			</ul>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some of their personal data from an

// 				individuals also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data to another organisation.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>However, the right to portability:</LegalParagraph>
// 			<ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
// 				<li>
// 					only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to {COMPANY_NAME} in electronic form; and
// 				</li>
// 				<li>onward transfer will only be available where this is &quot;technically feasible&quot;.</li>
// 			</ul>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, individuals
// 				have the right to correct, update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to
// 				rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete personal data
// 				completed - although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This may involve adding a
// 				supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				This right only applies to an individual&apos;s own personal data; a person cannot seek the rectification of
// 				another person&apos;s information.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach, we will investigate the
// 				incident and report it to the UK&apos;s data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do
// 				so.
// 			</LegalParagraph>
// 			<LegalParagraph>
// 				<strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a complaint with a relevant data
// 				protection authority. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a
// 				regulator, so please contact us in the first instance. Please provide us with as much information as you can
// 				about the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting
// 				out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.
